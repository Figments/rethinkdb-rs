These instructions were updated after the 1.16 release, but have not been tested.

# Compile from source #

## Get the build dependencies ##

Install the main dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install g++ protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev \
                     libboost-dev curl m4 wget libssl-dev
```

## Prepare the raspberrypi ##

Building RethinkDB require more memory than what is available on a Raspberry Pi.
Make sure you have a SWAP partition of at least 1GB.

Make also sure that you have at least 1GB available on your SD card.


## Get the source code ##

Download and extract the archive:

```bash
wget https://download.rethinkdb.com/dist/rethinkdb-{{site.version.full}}.tgz
tar xf rethinkdb-{{site.version.full}}.tgz
```

## Build RethinkDB ##

Kick off the build process:

```bash
cd rethinkdb-{{site.version.full}}
./configure --with-system-malloc --allow-fetch
make ALLOW_WARNINGS=1
sudo make install ALLOW_WARNINGS=1
```
